# sqlite_database_operations

##  Datasets 

two datasets were selected to complete this homework. The fisrt data set was from The Presbyterian Hospital and the second from the North Shore Rehabilitation Hospitals. These datasets can be found in the data folder within this repository. 

### Data exploration and analysis
After downloading the data, I proceeded to analyze the two sets, reviewing shape, columns, missing values, types, and descriptive statistics; as well as the frequency counts of some of the columns. 

### SQLite Operations
There were a few steps in this section: 
* Creating a local database
* Creating new tables using CREATE TABLE with SQlite
* Confirming the new table was create
* Inserting fake data using INSERT INTO wih SQlite
* Confirming the data was inserted
* Inserting real data from previous dataset into this new table
